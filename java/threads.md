## Getting Super Powers

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:



```python
import os
print('goose')
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```
// Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```

$$
f\left(
   \left[ 
     \frac{
       1+\left\{x,y\right\}
     }{
       \left(
          \frac{x}{y}+\frac{y}{x}
       \right)
       \left(u+1\right)
     }+a
   \right]^{3/2}
\right)
\tag{行标}
